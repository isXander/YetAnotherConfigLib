# YetAnotherConfigLib 3.0.0-beta.7+1.20

This version adds no features, nor bug fixes, instead it implements a breaking change:

**The YACL package has changed** to `dev.isxander.yacl3` and **the YACL mod-id has changed** to `yet_another_config_lib_v3`.
This is to prevent conflicts with 2.0, so you can load both versions at the same time so older mods don't break.
