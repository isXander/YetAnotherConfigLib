# YetAnotherConfigLib 3.1.0 for 1.20

## API Changes

### `ListOption` changes

A PR by [Crendgrim](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/89) - thanks a lot!

- Allow to specify size limits for option lists.
  - This allows to set a minimum and maximum length for the option list with the `minimumNumberOfEntries`
    and `maximumNumberOfEntries` builder methods.
- Allow "reversed" lists that add new options at their end.
  - List options until now always grew at the top. This patch allows you to manipulate this behaviour with the
    `insertEntriesAtEnd` builder method.

### `ImageRenderer` changes

Added a `tick()` method to image renderers that allows to update the image in a regular interval.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where image renderers were rendered twice per frame.
- Updated the ImageIO dependency to fix sometimes buggy animated WebP rendering.
- Fixed the name of the list being rendered on every entry of said list.

## Language Updates

- Added Tatar translation (by [Amirhan-Taipovjan-Greatest-I](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/90))
