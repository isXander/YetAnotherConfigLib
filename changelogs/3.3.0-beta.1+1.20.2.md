# YetAnotherConfigLib 3.3.0 (Beta 1) for Minecraft 1.20.2

As you can see, a lot of the contributions to this release are from other people! That's incredible, and I'm very
thankful for the community commitment to this project!

This release is a beta release, which just means that I'm not 100% sure that everything works as intended.
I encourage developers to at least try this build out, and if there are no problems, you're safe to release (I hope!).

## New Features

- Added new methods to add options to groups and categories, including conditional adding and option suppliers.
  This increases the chances you don't need to break the huge builder chain present of YACL, so you can just keep writing,
  even if you need to conditionally add an option, or run some code around the option. Look for `optionIf`!

## Changes

- Support for the `Home` and `End` keys. ([#108](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/108))
- Add functionality for `Ctrl + Left/Right` (you can now jump over words, without selecting it). ([#108](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/108))
- Make the 'finding the next word' functionality more consistent with other programs. ([#108](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/108))
- Caret now pauses flickering when moving it. ([#108](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/108))
- Position the caret and the highlight area being the same height as the text. ([#108](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/108))
- Render the caret above the selection, instead of below. ([#108](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/108))

## Fixes

- Fix `NumberFieldController` increasing their values by a power of 10 when clicking on the screen. Issue @ [#103](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/issue/103) PR @ [#108](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/108)
- Fix values not updating when unfocusing a string controller. ([#108](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/108))
- Fix a bug where the caret is not rendered at the beginning of the text in string/number field controllers. ([#108](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/108))
- Fix dropdowns not being sorted correctly with capital letters. ([#114](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/114))

## Misc

- Added debug JVM property `-Dyacl3.debug.imageFiltering=true/false` which applies experimental filtering to images
  to make them look better. I'd like your feedback on this!
- You now no longer need to add additional repositories to your `build.gradle`.
  You can safely remove:
  - `https://maven.quiltmc.org/repository/release/`
  - `https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/`

## Translation Updates

- Add Dutch translation. ([#121](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/121))
- Add Italian translation. ([#107](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/107))
